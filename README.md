#python API Data Pipeline (Trial Project)
This is a very simple trial python project to demonstrate basic API interaction and data transformation by:
1-Fetching data from a public API
2-Transforming the API response by converting the title to upper case, and capitalizing the first letter of the body
3-Printing the data in all the stages during the ETL process (raw fetched data, transformed data, and loading the data into a file named transformed_data.json saved to the project directory)
## this project uses the requests library
